In many cases, it is common to have a collection with multiple items of different data types. There are two ways to serialise multiple items at once into a collection, either using an aggregated config file, or using multiple config files.

In this tutorial, we will be describing the asset [Werribee.geojson](./vector_geometry.md), [vegetation_cover.tif](./raster.md#uncommonunknown-bands), and [soil_data.csv](./point.md#generic-point-data) from the previous tutorials.

Note that regardless of which method is used, each config entry must be a valid config, and the id for each config entry must be unique. The program will raise an error if either of those conditions are not fulfilled. 

## Multiple config files

Prepare the configs as described in the previous tutorials: 

- [vector_simple_config.json](./vector_geometry.md#config)
- [raster_custom_config.json](./raster.md#config-1)
- [point_simple_config.json](./point.md#config)

Then run the following command: 

```bash 
stac_generator serialise \
  vector_simple_config.json\ 
  raster_custom_config.json\ 
  point_simple_config.json
```

To serialise items from multiple configs, we simply add the configs as positional parameters in the command line application. 

## An aggregated config

To prepare an aggregated config, we simply add config item entries as a list to the config file: 

=== "json"

    ``` json title="composite_config.json" linenums="1"
    [
      {
        "id": "Werribee",
        "location": "Werribee.geojson",
        "collection_date": "2025-01-01",
        "collection_time": "00:00:00"
      },
      {
        "id": "vegetation_cover",
        "location": "vegetation_cover.tif",
        "collection_date": "2021-02-21",
        "collection_time": "10:00:17",
        "band_info": [
          {
            "name": "vegetation",
            "description": "Vegetation cover level"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "soil_data",
        "location": "soil.csv",
        "collection_date": "2020-01-01",
        "collection_time": "10:00:00",
        "X": "Longitude",
        "Y": "Latitude",
        "epsg": 4326,
        "column_info": [
          {
            "name": "Ca_Soln",
            "description": "Calcium solution in ppm"
          },
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

=== "yaml"

    ``` yaml title="composite_config.yaml" linenums="1"
    - id: "Werribee"
      location: "Werribee.geojson"
      collection_date: "2025-01-01"
      collection_time: "00:00:00"
    - id: vegetation_cover
      location: vegetation_cover.tif
      collection_date: '2021-02-21'
      collection_time: '10:00:17'
      band_info:
      - description: Vegetation cover level
        name: vegetation  
    - id: soil_data
      location: soil_data.csv
      epsg: 4326
      X: Longitude
      Y: Latitude
      collection_date: '2020-01-01'
      collection_time: '10:00:00'
      column_info:
      - description: Calcium solution in ppm
        name: Ca_Soln
    ```

The collection can then be generated by running the command: 

```bash 
stac_generator serialise composite.json
```
